Welcome to the Cyberpatriot Script
Developer: Sharad
Team: Andrew
Directions:
To use this script first start out with running Script.sh
This will download all the nessacary files from the the Cyberpatrtiot checklist
To run the script do:
sh (Filename).sh
However, if you already have run Script.sh, and want to get back to the menu run Shortcut.sh instead.
This will skip all the downloading and will get right to the menu
Also, when you run 4 it will make a ports.txt file. This will contain all of the port information
Good Luck!
